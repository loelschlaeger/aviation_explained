# Preface {-}

Welcome to my continuously growing collection of knowledge about aviation. 

Disclaimer: The collection is highly simplified. It only serves as an overview of general aviation topic. I am not a professional pilot, I only own a private pilot license. 

My goal with this document is a question - answer style. Abbreviations and definitions are collected [in the last section](#abbreviations-and-definitions).

The first chapter starts with a summary of common units in aviation.

Questions? Remarks? Please let me know via an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/loelschlaeger/aviation_explained/issues/new).
