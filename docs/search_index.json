I still have to find out why. 🤷 1.1 Vertical distance Vertical distances (like distance from ground) are usually expressed in meters or in feets. 1.2 Horizontal distance Here we have nautical miles (abbreviated NM), kilometers and meters (usually for distances below 5km). 1.3 Speed Speed is usually measured in knots. Vertical speed is measured in feet per minute. 1.4 Mass Kilogram, pound (lb). 1.5 Temperature Degree Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin. 1.6 Air pressure Hecto pascals (hPa), millibars, inches of mercury. 1.7 Time UTC "],["air-law.html", "2 👮 Air Law 2.1 Licensing 2.2 Rules of the air 2.3 Air traffic management 2.4 AIP 2.5 Aeronautical information service AIS 2.6 Air Traffic Service ATS 2.7 Aerodroms 2.8 Aircraft operations", " 2 👮 Air Law ICAO states. EU law. National law. 2.1 Licensing You need a license to fly as a crew member in any aircraft. The start is usually the private pilot license (PPL). If you want to get paid for flying, you need a commercial pilot license (CPL). Furthermore, you need so-called ratings for certain privileges or for flying special aircraft types. For example, you an instrument rating is required for flying in bad weather. All the rules for obtaining a license or rating and for revalidation are stated by part flight crew licensing (FCL) of EU regulation 1178. 2.2 Rules of the air Another EU regulation numbered 923 formulates standardized european rules of the air (short SERA). I list some important ones below. 2.2.1 Visual versus instrument flight rules Flights are either performed under visual flight rules (VFR) or instrument flight rules (IFR). The former means that the aircraft operates in nice and clear weather and avoids clouds, heady precipitation etc. SERA.5005 formulates conditions for VFR flights. Flying under IFR avoids these meteorological requirements, however, an instrument rating and certain aircraft equipment are required, see SERA.5015. In the cited references you also find rules for minimum flying heights: When under IFR, you should fly at least 300 m above the highest obstacle located within 8 km of the estimated position of the aircraft, 600 m over high terrain or in mountainous areas (except for take-off or landing, obviously). Under VFR, the height minimum is lower: 150 m over rural areas. 2.2.2 Position reporting SERA.8025 states that controlled flights must maintain two-way communications and make position reports at certain reporting points. The format is standardized: Aircraft identification Position Time Altitude Next position Ensuing point Memory rule: All Pilots Take Aircraft Navigation Exams 2.2.3 Vertical seperations RVSM airspace vertical separations: Add image. &lt; FL 290: 1000 ft FL 290 - FL 410 in RVSM: 1000 ft else: 2000 ft (standard) FL 410: 2000 ft Semi-circular rules: Add image. 0 - 179 degree magnetic: ODD 180 - 359 degree magnetic: EVEN Minimum flight level: 600 m (2000 ft) above highest obstacle within 8 km in mountainous areas elsewhere 300 m (1000 ft) 2.2.4 Communication failure VFR: Squawk 7600 and land at nearest suitable airport IFR in VMC: Continue VFR and land directly IFR in IMC: Follow flight plan and land within 30 minutes of ETA no radar: last assigned speed / level for 20 minutes radar: last assigned speed / level for 7 minutes In an emergency, Transponder mode A, Squawk 7700 2.2.5 Holding procedures Turns: right (standard) Outbound time: - below 14.000 ft: 1min - above 14.000 ft: 1,5 min 25 degree bank or 3 degree per second (whichever is less) Buffer area: 5NM Entry procedures (5 degrees flexibility on each side): Figure 2.1: Direct holding entry. Figure 2.2: Teardrop holding entry. Figure 2.3: Parallel holding entry. Memory rule: The name of the holding procedure describes the flight path after the holding fix. Minimum permissible holding height: 300 m obstc. clearance Shuttle: climb / descend in holding adapt timing (tail/headwind) and heading (wind correction angle) to maintain the track 2.2.6 Altimeter settings Add image of Transition level / layer / altitude Transition altitude not less than 3000 ft AGL Calculated height of transition altitude rounded up to next full 1000 ft Calculate transition level from transition altitude (will be passed to aircraft by ATS): TA: 3000 ft, QNH: 990 hPa, (1013 hPa - 990 hPa) * 30 ft/hPa = 660 ft, hence if changing the altimeter reference at 3000 ft to standard pressure would have 3660 ft altitude, hence TL is 4000 ft = FL 40. Transition altitudes are published in AIPs or SIDs 2.3 Air traffic management 2D separation: horizontal and vertical Longitudinal separation minima: on track: 5 (3) min if proceeding aircraft is 20 kts (40kts) faster departure: 3 min if proceeding aircraft is 40 kts faster levels crossed: 15 min (default), 10 min (regular fixes), 5 min (absolute minimum) on same NDB: more than 30 degrees at distance greater than 15 NM from facility same VOR: more than 15 degrees at distance greater than 15 NM from facility DME: 20 NM (10NM if 20 kts faster) clearance to land: at the latest 2 NM from touchdown no more speed control: 4 NM or less from touchdown report significant wind changes: - head: 10kts - cross: 5kts - tail: 2 kts 2.4 AIP GEN: Services, Sigmet, S and R, location indicators, fees, local regulations ENR: communication failures, runway signals, holding/approach/departure procedures AD: fueling, meterological information, runway lightning 2.5 Aeronautical information service AIS Movement area: manoeuvring area, aprons, maintenance stands apron: load and unload, parking, refueling, maintenance airside: AIRAC: Advanced! 2.5.1 Transponder Std Squawk: IFR: 2000 VFR: 7000 unop: 0000 Transponder failure before dep.: Permission to proceed to nearest suitable airport for repair. 2.5.2 Operations on two parallel runways: segregate: one only departures, one only approaches semi-mixed: one both, one only one mixed: both on both progressive: does not exist 2.6 Air Traffic Service ATS Class Type Separation Service Speed Limit Radio Clearance A IFR from all ATC B IFR from all ATC VFR from all ATC C IFR from all ATC VFR from IFR ATC yes* D IFR from IFR ATC yes* VFR FIS yes* E IFR from IFR ATC yes* VFR FIS yes* no no F IFR from IFR FIS yes* no VFR FIS yes* no no G IFR FIS yes* no VFR FIS yes* no no *Speed Limit: Below 10000ft AMSL is 250 kt IAS. 2.7 Aerodroms 2.7.1 Runway TODA: Take-off distance avaiable (TORA + clearway) TORA: Take-off run available ASDA: Accelerated stop distance available (TORA + stopway) RESA: Runway end safety area (at the end of the runway strip) LDA: Landing distance available Figure 2.4: Runway zones. 2.7.2 Lightning Figure 2.5: Runway lights. 2.7.3 Signs Mandatory instructions: White inscription on red background C: Visiting pilots should report Location signs: Yellow writing on black background 2.7.4 Approach aids PAPI APAPI Approach lighting system: Simple (SALS) and precision (PALS) Number of runway stripes: round up runway width / 4 2.8 Aircraft operations 2.8.1 Departure Obstacle clearance method for departures with no track guidance: omni-directional: restricted sectors specified by bearings and distances straight (&lt; 15 degree deviation from extended runway): track guidance within 20km turn (&gt; 15 degree): guidance within 10km Minimum obstacle clearance: 0.8% of horizontal distance in straight departures Procedure design gradient: 2.5% (at least) + 0,8% (additional margin) = 3,3% 2.8.2 Approach The approach consists of the following segments: arrival initial intermediate (ends at the FAF/FAP, the FAP is at a maximum (minimum, optimum) of 10 (3, 5) NM from threshold) final missed approach, which is separated again in three segments: initial intermediate (ends where 50m obstacle clearance is obtained and can be maintained) final Figure 2.6: Approach segments.

"],["instrumentation.html", "3 🎺 Instrumentation", " 3 🎺 Instrumentation "],["flight-planning.html", "4 📆 Flight Planning 4.1 Flight plan", " 4 📆 Flight Planning 4.1 Flight plan Filing a flight plan - for some flights you have to (IFR flights, international flights), for all flights you can (to facilitate SAR operations). A flight plan is a standardized sheet of information on an intended flight provided to air traffic control, see SERA.4001. They can be submitted online, via telephone, or even in-flight via radio. A plan should be closed on a safe arrival. Let’s do an example. Say we fly under instrument flight rules from Hamburg to Duesseldorf in a Cessna 172. A flight plan could look like follows: 4.1.1 Item 7: Aircraft identification Either the registration or a company callsign. 4.1.2 Item 8: Flight rules, Type of flight The flight rule goes into the first part of box 8 and can be I (IFR), V (VFR), Y (IFR changes to VFR), Z (VFR changes to IFR). Next comes the type of flight, which can be S (scheduled), N (non-scheduled), G (general aviation), M (military), X (others). 4.1.3 Item 9: Number and type of aircraft, Wake turbulence category Here you would insert the number (greater than one) of aircraft if you fly in a formation. Next the ICAO code for the aircraft type, and then the wake turbulence category: H for heavy (), M for medium (), and L for light () based on the maximum certified takeoff mass. 4.1.4 Item 10: Equipment Letters indicating the communication, navigation, and transponder equipment. There are many options: N for none, S for standard equipment (VHF, ADF, VOR, ILS), D for DME, C for mode C transponder, etc. 4.1.5 Item 13: Departure aerodrome, Departure time Use the aerodrome ICAO code or ZZZZ (with an entry in item 18) if there is none. The departure time is the anticipated (estimated) off-block time EOTB in hours and minutes UTC. 4.1.6 Item 15: Cruise Speed, Cruising level, Route Box 15 is the planned initial cruise TAS with the prefix N for knots, M for mach number, and K for kilometers per hour. For the cruising level, either A for altitude in hundreds of feet ASL or F for flight level. Under Route, include speed and altitude changes, airway numbers and waypoints on the route. You can use DCT for a direct route. 4.1.7 Item 16: Destination aerodrome, Flight time, Alternate (and second alternate) aerodrome As for item 13, use the ICAO code for the destination and alternate aerodrome. The EET (for Estimated Elapsed Time) is from takeoff to the IAF. 4.1.8 Item 18: Other information Use 0 if there is nothing to add. RMK/ means remarks. Critical life (STS/MEDEVAC), transport to hospital (STS/HOSP). 4.1.9 Supplementary information The hours and minutes of fuel endurance go into box 19. You can use TBN if you don’t know the number of passengers yet. Cross out every emergency and survival equipment that you don’t have. Finally, include your name and license number, and the person to be notified if SAR is initiated.
