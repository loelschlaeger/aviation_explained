I still have to find out why. 🤷 1.1 Vertical distance Vertical distances (like distance from ground) are usually expressed in meters or in feets. 1.2 Horizontal distance Here we have nautical miles (abbreviated NM), kilometers and meters (usually for distances below 5km). 1.3 Speed Speed is usually measured in knots. Vertical speed is measured in feet per minute. 1.4 Mass Kilogram, pound (lb). 1.5 Temperature Degree Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin. 1.6 Air pressure Hecto pascals (hPa), millibars, inches of mercury.
