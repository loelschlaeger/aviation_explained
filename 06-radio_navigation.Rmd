# `r emo::ji("satellite_antenna")` Radio Navigation {#radio-navigation}

Relative bearing to station (ADF, VOR), radial from station (VOR), distance from station (DME), actual position (GPS, RNAV, INS).

## VOR

- very high frequency omnidirectional range

- VHF, 108 - 117.975 MHz (just below aviation voice channels)

- VHF carrier wave modulated by two LF signals, using phase difference comparison between them to signifz aircraft direction from transmitting station as one of 360 radials from it

### DME
